# ✅ All Errors and Warnings Fixed!

## Summary

All errors and warnings from your `npm run dev` output have been successfully resolved.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ⨯ Conflicting favicon.ico ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
⨯ A conflicting public file and page file was found for path /favicon.ico
GET /favicon.ico 500
```

**Solution:**
- Removed `src/app/favicon.ico` (conflicting file)
- Kept `public/favicon.ico` as the single source
- Result: `GET /favicon.ico 200 ✓`

### 2. GET /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 404 ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
GET /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 404
```

**Solution:**
- Created `public/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`
- iOS Safari requests this variant
- Result: `GET /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 200 ✓`

### 3. ⚠ Webpack/Turbopack Conflict ✅ FIXED
**Warning:**
```
⚠ Webpack is configured while Turbopack is not, which may cause problems.
```

**Solution:**
- Updated `package.json` to remove `--turbopack` flags
- `next-pwa` requires Webpack, so we use Webpack for both dev and build
- Result: No more warnings ✓

### Notes
All component files (`src/components/*.tsx`) and API routes (`src/app/api/*/route.ts`) were already present in the repository. The main change was creating the new `page.tsx` that implements the desired workflow.

## Key Changes

1. **Created new main page** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
   - Implements simple, form-based workflow
   - AI-powered auto-fill from product idea
   - Live preview while editing
   - Section-based refinement
   
2. **Preserved old implementation** (`src/app/page.legacy.tsx`)
   - Kept for reference and potential future use
   - Repository analysis features remain available

3. **Updated documentation**
   - README with full feature list and workflow diagram
   - Quick start guide for new users
   - Environment setup instructions

## Migration from Legacy

| Feature | Legacy (page.legacy.tsx) | Current (page.tsx) |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Input Method | Git-ingest file upload | Simple form + product idea |
| Workflow | 3-tab interface | Single-page, 2-column layout |
| Auto-fill | Not available | ‚úÖ AI-powered from product idea |
| Preview | Post-generation only | ‚úÖ Live preview while typing |
| Complexity | Advanced (technical users) | Simple (all users) |
| Primary Use Case | Analyze existing code | Create new PRDs |

## Backward Compatibility

The previous workflow is still available in `page.legacy.tsx` if needed. To switch back:

```bash
# Backup current page
mv src/app/page.tsx src/app/page.new.tsx

# Restore legacy version
mv src/app/page.legacy.tsx src/app/page.tsx
```

However, the new workflow is recommended for most users as it's simpler and more accessible.

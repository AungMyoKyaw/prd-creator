- Use case numbers follow the format UC-XXX
- Requirement IDs follow the format REQ-XXX

### 1.3 Intended Audience
This document is intended for:
- Software developers working on the application
- Quality assurance team members
- Product owners and project managers
- System architects
- Technical stakeholders

### 1.4 Product Scope
PRD Creator is a web-based application that uses AI to generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents from user-provided information.

The system provides the following primary functions:
- User input collection through a structured form interface
- AI-powered generation of PRD documents
- Real-time preview of PRD content
- Export functionality for generated documents
- Model selection and configuration for AI generation
- Section refinement based on user feedback

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
**Primary Users:**
- Product managers
- Startup founders
- Technical leads
- UX designers

**Characteristics:**
- Familiar with basic web interfaces
- Have product ideas that need documentation
- Need to communicate technical concepts to development teams

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The application runs in modern web browsers supporting:
- JavaScript ES2020+
- Web Storage API
- Service Worker API (for PWA features)
- Fetch API

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must use client-side storage only (no server-side storage of API keys)
- Should support offline functionality for core UI
- Must maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- AI processing must occur through external API calls

### 3.2 Hardware Interfaces
No specific hardware interfaces required beyond standard computing devices with web browsers.

### 3.3 Software Interfaces
**Google Gemini API:**
- API endpoint for content generation
- API endpoint for model listing
- Authentication using API key

**Browser APIs:**
- LocalStorage for configuration storage
- Service Workers for PWA functionality
- Clipboard API for content copying

### 3.4 Communications Interfaces
- HTTPS for secure communication with AI API
- Standard web protocols for PWA installation
